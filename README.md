<h1>Using Python for understanding a function of two variables</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The aim of this project is to show how Python (paticularly via tools in SymPy and Matplotlib) may be used to help understand functions of two variables.

We will define a function, illustrate it using surface and contour plots, and locate every stationary point of the function, identifying the nature of each such point. Finally we'll look at maxima and minima subject to a constraint.

The function we will be working with is $f(x,y)= (x^3+y^3+xy) \cdot e^{-x^2-y^2}.$
